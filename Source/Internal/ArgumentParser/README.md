# ERS Internal Library: ArgumentParser

## Description

The ArgumentParser library is responsible for reading, parsing and interpreting command line arguments passed into the program. For example, when opening a project, a command line argument is passed to the new instance of ERS via the CLI. This module reads those, parses them, and delivers that information to the relevant subsystems.
