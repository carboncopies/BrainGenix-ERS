# ERS Internal Library: LoggingSystem

## Description

The LoggingSystem provides a unified logging environment for the entire system to push data to. When logs are generated by other parts of the system, it's the logger's responsibillity to collect those logs and store them for future use by users/admins/developers. The Logger should support saving logs to disk, as well as pushing them to the database for storage.

The system also supports color formatting to make the logs more human-readable.
